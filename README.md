this github repository contains a detailed step by step LSTM model for the NASA CMaps dataset
Milestone 1 - contains loading the data preprecessing,sequence generations and saving the csv files and the sequences generated
Milestone 2 - contains LSTM model building 
Milestone 3 & 4 - evaluationg the trained model and adding the predictions labels like warning,normal and critical.
MileStone 5 - building a interactice web dashboard for the above models and datsets where the model performance can be viewed visually.
